My laboratory is broadly focused on developing and using **computational approaches to understand life at the molecular level**. I am particularly interested in exploring large-scale cancer genomics datasets, integrating different types of data to gain insights into the molecular bases of cancer and immune system function.

**Ongoing projects in my lab:**

- Developing computational approaches to  model and characterize the T Cell Receptor/pMHC complex, one of the key components of our immune system

- Building machine learning infrastructure to automatically annotate pathology slides (collaboration with the [Ligorio Lab](https://ligoriolab.com/lab-2/))

- Agent-based modeling of complex biological systems


- Fragment-based drug discovery
